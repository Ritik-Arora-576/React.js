<h3 align='center'>Commands to create new React App</h3>
Go into the VS code terminal and execute the following commands:<br><br>
<strong>1. npx create-react-app <em>application_name</em>:</strong> Use to create an application folder in which all required files gets stored.
<br>
<strong>2. cd <em>application_name</em>:</strong> Get into the application which has been created.
<br>
<strong>3. npm start:</strong> Start the application on browser locally.
<br>
<br>
<strong>NOTE:</strong>
<ul>
  <li><em>npm</em> command is use for downloading the packages permanently into the hard drive while <em>npx</em> command is use for utilizing the packages for the temporary use.</li>
  <li>The HTML which is written under <em>App.js</em> gets displayed onto the browser.</li>
  <li><em>App.js</em> contains a function which returns JSX component (JavaScript XML). Function only returns one JSX component in which we can write JavaScript alongwith HTML to make development easy.</li>
  <li>In JSX instead of writing <em>'class'</em> we use <em>'className'</em>. Tags which are not having closing tags eg.<em>"<img src='img.png'>"</em> gets closed in JSX by using <em>"<img src='img.png'/>"</em>.</li>
  <li><em>node_modules</em> folder contains all the dependencies of the react project. All the dependencies are written inside <em>package.json</em> and <em>package-lock.json</em> and can be re-install <em>node_modules</em> by using the command <em>'npm install'</em>.</li>
</ul>
